"""The conversational agent: an OpenRouter tool-calling loop.

Flow per user turn:
  1. system prompt (role + schema card + grounding rules) + prior history + the
     new user message are sent to the agent model with the tool specs.
  2. If the model calls a tool, we execute it via :func:`dispatch_tool`, append
     the tool result, and loop — up to ``MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS`` times.
  3. When the model returns prose, that's the answer. Collected tool provenance
     is returned as ``sources`` (Block 9 explainability).

Conversation memory is *stateless here*: the caller passes recent history and
receives the new turns back to persist. Postgres persistence is layered on in
the router.
